Hi, 

I'm a freelancer that's fascinated by complex problems and creating elegant systems that scale nicely to serve the needs of their clients. 

My experience is focused on JVM languages, with quite a few years of development in both Java and Scala in industries ranging from travel, banking, railways to logistics. 

If you are interested in hiring me, then don't hesitate to check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiaansamyn/) and drop me a message.

Kind Regards, \
Sebastiaan Samyn
